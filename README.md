# Instagram Reach Forecasting using ARIMA Model

## Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting Instagram reach using an ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model. By analyzing historical reach data, we aim to predict future reach values, providing valuable insights for social media marketing strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains daily Instagram reach data. It includes timestamps and corresponding reach numbers. Before analysis, the dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values and ensure data consistency.

## Methodology
The ARIMA modeling technique was applied to capture the time-dependent patterns and trends in the Instagram reach data. The model's order (p, d, q) was determined through a combination of visual inspection and statistical tests. 
Differencing was employed to address non-stationarity if present in the data.

## Results
The ARIMA model was trained and applied to the Instagram reach dataset to generate forecasts.
While formal model evaluation metrics were not performed in this iteration of the project, the model's performance was visually assessed by comparing the forecasted values to the actual reach values. 
Further evaluation and analysis of the model's accuracy and performance can be conducted in future iterations.

## Usage and Reproduction
To reproduce the results of this project, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
2. Run the data preprocessing script (preprocess_data.py) to clean and format the Instagram reach dataset.
3. Train the ARIMA model by executing the train_arima_model.py script, which fits the model to the preprocessed data.
4. Generate forecasts using the trained ARIMA model by running the generate_forecasts.py script
5. Evaluate the forecasted results using appropriate evaluation metrics and visualizations.
   
## Future Enhancements
1. Explore advanced variations of ARIMA models like SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) to account for potential seasonal patterns in Instagram reach.
2. Investigate the impact of exogenous variables, such as holidays or marketing campaigns, on reach forecasting accuracy.
3. Implement machine learning techniques, such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), to compare and potentially improve forecasting performance.
